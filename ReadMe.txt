This program simulates a traffic situation, where you are given a situation where 
it repeats a cycle, as follows: the light first turns green on eastbound, which then
both east and west turn red, and then westbound  turns green, and finally both lights turn red.

It uses eastbound and westbound semaphores to control the traffic simulation, and 
takes into account the amount of cars waiting during a red light.
